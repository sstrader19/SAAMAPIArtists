From a young age he traveled with his family on vacations to Europe, where paintings by Leonardo, Titian, Veronese, and Turner made a huge impression on him. Porter graduated with a degree in fine art from Harvard in 1928 and moved to New York, where he attended the Art Students League for two years. During the Great Depression, he became involved in politics and Socialism, which led him to writing assignments for the Socialist magazine <i>Arise.</i> He wrote art criticism throughout his life, and in 1951 he was appointed associate editor for <i>Art News.</i> Although a representational painter during a period more noted for abstraction, Porter rejected claims that he was continuing the tradition of American realist painting. He felt that his ambitions had more in common with the abstract artists of his generation such as Willem de Kooning and Joan Mitchell, because he valued the process of painting more highly than any desire to accurately record the subject in front him. Porter's paintings often depict his immediate environment and were mostly created at the family house in Southampton, New York, or at his vacation home at Great Spruce Head Island, Maine.</p>",

Porter, born in Baltimore in 1905, was the first African-American art historian. His 1943 book, <i>Modern Negro Art,</i> was the earliest comprehensive treatment of African-American art and remains a classic in its field. He attended public schools in the District of Columbia and later graduated from Howard University in 1927. He became an art instructor at the university and chairman of its art department, a position he retained until his death. Porter attended graduate school at Columbia University and the Art Students League in New York where he studied with the painter Dimitri Romanowsky. During the summer of 1935 Porter used a fellowship from the Institute of International Education to study medieval archaeology at the Institut d'Art etd'Arch&eacute;ologie at the Sorbonne in Paris. After completing his studies in Paris, Porter received a stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation for extensive travel in Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Italy. Porter stated that the purpose of his trip was \"To make a first-hand study of certain collections of African Negro arts and crafts housed in important museums of ethnography. . . .\"</p><p>On a leave of absence from Howard University, during the school year 1945 and 1946, Porter again received financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation to visit cultural facilities in Cuba and Haiti. In 1955 he was appointed a fellow of the Belgium-American Art Seminar, and pursued further studies in the history of Flemish and Dutch art of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries while in Belgium. Porter's final educational trip abroad&mdash;to West Africa in 1963&mdash;was sponsored by a grant from the <i>Evening Star,</i> a Washington, D.C., newspaper. There he conducted research for a book on West African architecture, and completed a series of twenty-five paintings dealing with West African themes. These paintings were exhibited in the Gallery of Art at Howard University following his return.</p><p>Primarily an educator and writer, Porter was also an artist and completed a number of important drawings and paintings. Charcoal drawings from an early sketchbook reveal that he was a sensitive draftsman. It was in the areas of portrait painting, figure studies, and still lifes, however, that he excelled; his most successful works were oil portraits of family and friends. He also completed a group of paintings depicting scenes and local residents during his trips to Haiti and Cuba.</p><p>In 1966 Porter was honored by President Lyndon B. Johnson on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the National Gallery of Art as one of America's most outstanding men of the arts.\" James Porter, remembered for his significant role in establishing the art department and gallery at Howard University, his pioneering research, and writings in the field of African-American art history, served most importantly as a teacher and mentor to generations of students.</p><p>Porter's works were shown frequently in group exhibitions throughout his career. In 1940 he was represented in the American Negro Exposition in Chicago, and in 1948 the Barnett-Aden Gallery in Washington, D.C., mounted a one-man exhibition of his works.</p><p>Regenia A.

Pousette-Dart briefly attended nearby Bard College before moving to New York City to devote himself full time to painting and sculpture.</p><p>Along with artists Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning, Pousette-Dart became a founder of the New York School, which thrived during the immediate postwar decade. Like its other members, Pousette-Dart turned away from realism, creating abstract, spontaneous-seeming compositions that incorporated Freudian and Jungian symbolism and elements of European modernism. In the 1950s the artist produced a series of white paintings with penciled lines in which the bird motif of his small brass sculptures from the 1930s reappeared. Abandoning the all-white approach in the late fifties, Pousette-Dart began to build up thick, stucco-like surfaces of expressive color. His work grew in scale in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the late seventies his simplified, pointillist compositions were suggesting exploding stars, planets, and the depths of infinite space.</p><p>Throughout his career, Pousette-Dart also taught painting at a number of New York institutions, including the New School for Social Research, the School of Visual Arts, Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence College, and the Art Students League. In 1981 he received the first annual \"Distinguished Lifetime in Art\" award from the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation. The following year Pousette-Dart was chosen by the International Committee of the Venice Biennale to exhibit in the main pavilion.</p><p><i>National Museum of American Art</i> (CD-ROM) (New York and Washington D.C.: MacMillan Digital in cooperation with the National Museum of American Art, 1996)</p>",

        "value": "<P>Studied sculpture with Frederick Eckstein, a Prussian artist working in Cincinnati. Repaired and mechanized wax figures for the Western Museum in Cincinnati. 1828, first portrait commissions. 1834, patron Nicholas Longworth sent him to Washington to produce portraits of leading Americans, among them Andrew Jackson; then to Europe, 1836. After Paris, went with family to Florence, 1837. Lived there the rest of his life, never returning to America. <I>The Greek Slave</I> exhibited in London, 1845 and again in 1851, establishing his international reputation. From that date, critical and financial success were assured. Died Florence, 27 June 1873.</P>\r<P>In terms of fame and financial success, Hiram Powers was the central American sculptor of the nineteenth century. He achieved this through the development\u2014one might even say the \"invention\"\u2014of a style that blended classical idealism, physical immediacy, and appealing subject matter with moral overtones. If to our eyes he seems less gifted than some of his colleagues, his place in the history of taste is nonetheless secure. The presence in the NMAA [now the Smithsonian American Art Museum] of the contents of his studio provides special insight not only into his art, but also into the working methods typical of the majority of nineteenth-century sculptors\u2014specifically the use of mechanical devices and professional carvers under the artist's direction.</P>\r<P>In his early sculpture, Powers reveals a taste and aptitude for naturalistic rendering. The outstanding example of this probing vision is his bust of Andrew Jackson, a work whose extraordinary incisiveness puts it in the forefront of American portrait sculpture. The sittings were obtained in 1835 through the intervention of his patron, Nicholas Longworth, and they provided Powers with a treasured anecdote as well as a superb likeness. He modeled the original clay bust (the plaster cast of which is now in the NMAA) with a fidelity that made the sixty-eight-year-old Jackson's toothlessness unmistakable.

The notable lack of originality in \"formal\" invention or composition, however, vitiates Powers's ambitious intention in Eve. With a serpent decorously draped around the sculpture's base and up the supporting tree trunk, the figure looks at the apple in her flaccid hand with unsurpassed blandness\u2014neither curious, nor distrustful, nor even hungry.

Although in his day Powers's religious themes were considered relevant, he did not depart from the established mode.

Repaired and mechanized wax figures for the Western Museum in Cincinnati. 1828, first portrait commissions. 1834, patron Nicholas Longworth sent him to Washington to produce portraits of leading Americans, among them Andrew Jackson; then to Europe, 1836. After Paris, went with family to Florence, 1837. Lived there the rest of his life, never returning to America. <I>The Greek Slave</I> exhibited in London, 1845 and again in 1851, establishing his international reputation. From that date, critical and financial success were assured. Died Florence, 27 June 1873.</P>\n<P>In terms of fame and financial success, Hiram Powers was the central American sculptor of the nineteenth century. He achieved this through the development\u2014one might even say the \"invention\"\u2014of a style that blended classical idealism, physical immediacy, and appealing subject matter with moral overtones. If to our eyes he seems less gifted than some of his colleagues, his place in the history of taste is nonetheless secure. The presence in the NMAA [now the Smithsonian American Art Museum] of the contents of his studio provides special insight not only into his art, but also into the working methods typical of the majority of nineteenth-century sculptors\u2014specifically the use of mechanical devices and professional carvers under the artist's direction.</P>\n<P>In his early sculpture, Powers reveals a taste and aptitude for naturalistic rendering. The outstanding example of this probing vision is his bust of Andrew Jackson, a work whose extraordinary incisiveness puts it in the forefront of American portrait sculpture. The sittings were obtained in 1835 through the intervention of his patron, Nicholas Longworth, and they provided Powers with a treasured anecdote as well as a superb likeness. He modeled the original clay bust (the plaster cast of which is now in the NMAA) with a fidelity that made the sixty-eight-year-old Jackson's toothlessness unmistakable.

For many years thereafter loosely handled watercolor remained his favored medium and gave his work vibrant spontaneity.</P>\r<P>A shy and retiring individual, he remained a bachelor throughout his life, closely attached to his artist brother Charles, who was also a successful frame maker. For three years Maurice studied in Paris at the Atelier Colarossi and the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. During one of his early stays in Paris he met the Canadian painter James Morrice, who introduced him to English avant-garde artists Walter Sickert and Aubrey Beardsley, all ardent admirers of James McNeill Whistler. Prendergast's aesthetic course was set. A further acquaintance with Vuillard and Bonnard placed him firmly in the postimpressionist camp. He developed and continued to elaborate a highly personal style, with boldly contrasting, jewel-like colors, and flattened, patternlike forms rhythmically arranged on a canvas. Forms were radically simplified and presented in flat areas of bright, unmodulated color. His paintings have been aptly described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics. A trip to Venice in 1898 exposed him to the delightful genre scenes of Vittore Carpaccio and encouraged him toward even more complex and rhythmic arrangements. He also became one of the first Americans to espouse the work of C\u00e9zanne and to understand and utilize his expressive use of form and color.</P>\r<P>In 1907, Prendergast was invited to exhibit with the Eight, colleagues of Robert Henri and exponents of the Ashcan school. Prendergast and the romantic symbolist Arthur B. Davies seem oddly mismatched to these urban realists, but all were united in an effort to stir the American art scene out of its conservative lethargy.</P>\r<P>In 1913 he was invited to participate in the famed Armory Show, which was largely arranged by his friend Davies. Not surprisingly, Prendergast's brilliantly unorthodox offerings were decried as resembling \"an explosion in a paint factory.\" On the same occasion Marcel Duchamp's <I>Nude Descending a Staircase</I> (1912) was similarly deplored as \"an explosion in a shingle factory,\" suggesting either a failure of critical imagination or a case of collegial plagiarism. But of the Americans represented there, Prendergast's works were the most thoroughly modern and postimpressionist.</P>\r<P>Who can now pass a playground teeming with brightly dressed children or wander through a public park where the varicolored garb of its occupants does not call to mind the stirring images Maurice Prendergast has left us?

From 1922 to 1924, Prestini attended a trade school in Westerly, Rhode Island, as an apprentice machinist.  He earned a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering at Yale University in 1930 and attended Yale's School of Education in 1932.

After having pursued such a path, in which he attempted to learn sign painting, he left school at the age of fourteen. At another fixture of immigrant life, the settlement house, he was introduced to the fine arts, winning a scholarship to the National Academy of Design. There he was a student of Charles Hawthorne and became acquainted with the work of the Ashcan School painters.</p><p>After his studies he established a studio in New York and began painting the life he saw around him. A series of stays at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, beginning in the summer of 1934, had a marked influence on his work. He spent eight summers in residence there, during one of which he met his wife, Elizabeth. Along with depictions of working-class city dwellers, he now began painting scenes that embodied \"small town individualism and egalitarianism.\" During the 1960s and '70s, Prestopino actively supported the civil rights and antiwar movements, donating the sales of his art and designs to benefit these causes. His later work moved away from the figure and toward abstraction.</p><p>William H. Truettner and Roger B. Stein, editors, with contributions by Dona Brown, Thomas Andrew Denenberg, Judith K.
