Badami traveled to America as a teenager, but soon returned to Sicily, relating that \"there's nothing to make money [in America]. At least in Corleone, I can sleep under the olive trees.\" During World War II, he was drafted into the Italian army and sent to North Africa. The British captured him and he spent six years as a prisoner of war in India and England. He settled in Omaha with his wife and daughter after his release, and worked for the Pacific-Union railroad. In 1960, Badami declared the work in a local art gallery to be a \"bunch of junk! I can do better,\" and immediately went home to paint a landscape on his dining room wall (Chuck Rosenak, \"Rediscovering Andrea Badami,\" <i>The Clarion</i>, Spring/Summer 1987).</p>",

In 1910 he immigrated to the United States, locating briefly in Boston before settling permanently in New York City. There he studied art at the National Academy of Design and subsequently enrolled at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design as its first sculpture student. In 1920 Baizerman won a public competition to create a Civil Liberty monument for Grant's Tomb in New York but rejected the coveted commission to pursue the possibilities of hammered metal, a technique he discovered while working on small cast bronzes. Intrigued by the transitory effects of light and shadow on hammered metal surfaces, Baizerman executed \"City and the People,\" his first series using the technique in hammered bronze. By 1921 he had started to work in hammered copper, which remained his preferred medium.</p><p>During the twenties Baizerman traveled frequently to Europe, lured by the need to prepare for a 1924 solo exhibition in London, as well as by the artistic and architectural treasures of France, Russia, and Italy. In 1931, however, the loss of almost all his art in a fire that demolished his studio effectively put an end to Baizerman's transatlantic journeys. Two years later, salvaging what he could from the ruins of his workshop, the artist presented his first American solo exhibition, featuring small bronzes from the twenties, at New York's Eighth Street Gallery. From 1934 to 1940 he conducted sculpture, drawing, and anatomy classes at his own art institute, the Baizerman Art School. After 1940, although he continued to teach at the American Artists School and the University of Southern California, Baizerman's energy primarily was directed to his own work.</p><p><i>National Museum of American Art</i> (CD-ROM) (New York and Washington D.C.: MacMillan Digital in cooperation with the National Museum of American Art, 1996)</p>",

His ability to model portraits and the figure won him a medal at the Royal Academy in 1911. A pacifist, he came to America to avoid military service at the outbreak of World War I and remained the rest of his life. Initially he established a studio in Boston, where he hired as an assistant young  Donald De Lue and supported himself through portraits and commissions for architectural sculpture. Baker's main interest, however, was figurative sculpture of imaginative subjects in a romantic, symbolist vein similar to the work of the French sculptor Auguste Rodin.

His drawing of a child in a haystack was pronounced the best in a class of older, more experienced students. Baldridge served as a staff illustrator in the First World War, capturing the swagger of American doughboys who perished on the fields of Belgium and France. In Paris as the war wound down, he met Caroline Singer, a Californian who had served in the Red Cross. Together, they forged a partnership, traveling to China and Japan, across the Middle East and into Africa. Caroline wrote books about their journeys and Cyrus contributed the sketches he had made as they wandered. Baldridge was a top illustrator in New York from the 1920s until 1952, when he and Caroline retired to Santa Fe, whose walled streets reminded them of Peking (modern-day Beijing). Caroline died of Alzheimers in the early 1960s, and Cyrus shot himself a decade later, after contracting cancer.</p>",

He made a career of portraying statesmen and historical figures, rendered in a naturalistic style somewhere between the inexpensive, moralizing sculpture groups cast in plaster by John Rogers and the high-style neoclassical marbles of Thomas Crawford and Hiram Powers. Ball was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts. The son of a house and sign painter, he served a brief apprenticeship with the Boston engraver Abel Brown before opening his own studio as a miniaturist and portrait painter. Soon after, Ball gave up his easel, distracted by a romantic disappointment and, according to legend, transferred his attention to a lump of clay. He found his calling and relocated to Italy. Although Ball made periodic trips back to the states, and his work was included in such major exhibitions as the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, he remained an expatriate until 1897, when he moved to Montclair, New Jersey.</p><p>William H.

        "value": "<p>\"All that I would do I cannot&#151;that is, all I could say in art &#151;simply from lack of training, but with God's help I hope to deliver the message he entrusted to me.\"  George W. Whitaker, \"Reminiscences of Providence Artists,\" <i>Providence Magazine, The Board of Trade Journal</i> (Feb. 1914): 139.</p><br /><p>Edward Mitchell Bannister's determination to become a successful artist was largely fueled by an inflammatory article he read in the <i>New York Herald</i> in 1867, that stated \"the Negro seems to have an appreciation for art while being manifestly unable to produce it.\" Ironically, less than a decade later, in 1876, Bannister was the first African-American artist to receive a national award.</p><p>Bannister was born in November 1828 in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada. His father was a native of Barbados, West Indies. The racial identity of Bannister's mother, Hannah Alexander Bannister, who lived in New Brunswick and whom Bannister credited with fostering his earliest artistic interests, is not known. Bannister's father apparently died early, and after the death of his mother in 1844 he lived with a white family in New Brunswick. Bannister left his foster home after several years and took a job at sea, as was customary for many young men from St. Andrews.</p><p>In 1848 Bannister moved to Boston where he held a variety of menial jobs before he became a barber and eventually learned to paint. Bannister painted in the Boston Studio Building, and also enrolled inseveral evening classes at Lowell Institute with the noted sculptor-anatomist Dr. William Rimmer.  Only a few of Bannister's paintings from the 1850s and 1860s have survived, preventing a stylistic assessment of his early period in Boston. While Bannister lived in Boston he must have seen and been influenced by the Barbizon School-inspired paintings of  William Morris Hunt who had studied in Europe and held numerous public exhibitions in Boston during the 1860s. American landscape painters were increasingly aware of the simple rustic motifs and pictorial poetry of French Barbizon paintings by Jean-Baptiste Corot, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet, and Charles-Fran&#231;ois Daubigny in the midnineteenth century.</p><p>On June 10, 1857, Bannister marriedChristiana Cartreaux, a Narragansett Indian who was born in North Kingston, Rhode Island. The couple had no children. Christiana worked as a wigmaker and hairdresser in Boston, and her Rhode Island background might have prompted the Bannisters to move from Boston to Providence, Rhode Island, in 1870.</p><p>Since Bannister's artistic studies were limited, it is remarkable, indeed, that within five years after his arrival in Providence, one of Bannister's paintings was accepted in thePhiladelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The painting, <i>Under the Oaks</i>, was selected for the first-prize bronze medal. Bannister related in considerable detail that the judges became indignant and originally wanted to \"reconsider\" the award upon discovering that Bannister was African American. The white competitors, however, upheld the decision and Bannister was awarded the bronze medal. The location of the painting has not been known since the turn of the century. </p><p>Following the Centennial Exposition, Bannister's reputation grew and numerous commissions enabled him to devote all his time to painting. He executed a large number of landscapes, most of which depict quiet, bucolic scenes rendered in somber tones and thick impasto. While Bannister'sinitial influence probably stemmed from the Barbizon-inspired works of William Morris Hunt, his paintings are reflective of an artist who loved the quiet beauties of nature and represented them in a realistic manner. Bannister's middle-period landscapes of the 1870s were generally executed in broad masses of heavy impasto with few details. They also evoke a tranquil mood that became one of the hallmarks of Bannister's style. Later landscapes of the 1880s and 1890s employed a more gentleimpasto and loosely applied broken color similar to impressionist techniques.</p><p>Many of Bannister's landscapes are small and have darkened considerably with age. His paintings contain no social or racial overtones, and the small figures seen frequently in his landscapes appear to be white. Although the majority of Bannister's paintings are landscapes, he also painted figure studies, religious scenes, seascapes, still lifes, and genre subjects. Bannister was attracted primarily to picturesque motifs including cottages, castles, cattle, dawns, sunsets, and small bodies of water, and he portrayed nature as a calm and submissive force in his works.</p><p>In spite of his limited training and experience, Bannister was among Providence's leading painters during the 1870s and 1880s. He was well liked and respected by his fellow citizens. On January 9, 1901, Bannister died while attending a prayer meeting at his church.  Shortly after his death, the Providence Art Club mounted a memorial exhibition of 101 of Bannister's paintings owned by Providence collectors. Bannister's grave in North Burial Ground, Providence, is marked by a rough granite boulder ten feet high bearing a carving of a palette with the artist's name and a pipe. A bronze plaque also adorns the monument and is inscribed with a poem, which reads in part, \"This pure and lofty soul . . . who, while he portrayed nature, walked with God.\"  Edward M.

Bannister's father apparently died early, and after the death of his mother in 1844 he lived with a white family in New Brunswick.

        "value": "<p>A painter, printmaker, and art teacher, Xavier Barile came to the United States from Italy when he was fifteen. He studied at the Cooper Union and Art Students League, but his greatest influence came from his teacher, John Sloan, a member of a group of artists known as the Ashcan School.

        "value": "<p>Defying social and family expectations, the wealthy, often eccentric Alice Pike Barney (1857&ndash;1931) zestfully committed herself to the arts and became known for her lively art salons, bohemian lifestyle, and unusual family.</p><p>Alice and her counterparts in other cities represented a new social type: women who lived proper upper-class lives but did not follow the rules, using their wealth and privilege to buy themselves freedoms and to promote causes the rich did not customarily embrace.  As an artist, writer, theater director, philanthropist, civic leader, and patron of the arts, Alice moved in the turn-of-the-century artistic circles of Paris, London, and Washington, D.C.</p><p>Throughout Alice's life, which often seemed a dramatic play of her own writing, she encoutered a brilliant cast of characters: among them Oscar Wilde, James McNeill Whistler, and the legendary explorer Henry Morton Stanley, whose impassioned offer of marriage she rejected.  Her easygoing personality and charming wit dazzled the artistic circles she traversed with such ease, winning the freindship of Anna Pavlova, Ara Bernhardt, Ruth St. Denis, and Emma Calv&eacute;, among many others.</p><p>Shortly after she turned nineteen, Alice accepted the marriage proposal of Gilded Age-industrialist Albert Clifford Barney.  Throughout their married life, Albert encouraged Alice to work at her social position rather than her artistic pursuits.  Her stubborn refusal to compromise her ideals infuriated him and led to continuous conflict.  They led separate lives for much of their marriage, Albert eventually drinking himself into an early grave, while Alice raised their two daughters, Natalie and Laura, and established her salon in Europe and the United States.</p><p>Alice began seriously painting during the Barneys' first trip to Paris in 1883, studing with Charles &Eacute;mile Auguste Carolus-Duran, a master portrait painter.  She continued painting on her return to the United States, winning accolates and a congressional commission, that shocked Washington society, who found it unseemly that a woman of wealth and social standing would paint at all.  She pursued the arts all her life, exhibiting a rare versatility between the fine arts and the performing arts.  After Albert's death, and during her subsequent marriage to Christian Hemmick, a man thirty years her junior, Alice devoted herself to the arts and converting Washington, D.C., from a cultural backwater to a true capital of the arts.</p><p>Among her other accomplishments, Alice designed and built what was considered an anomaly in her time, a studio house intended to provide a focus for the arts and artists of Washington, D.C.  The Studio House, as she called it, became the base for her manipulation of Washington culture.  However, foremost in Alice's intentions in building Studio House, was her desire to show others how to live artistically.  To this day, Studio House exists as one of the few extant examples of a turn-of-the-century artist's studio residence.</p><p>Jean L.
